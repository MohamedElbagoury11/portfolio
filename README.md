This repository contains a Vite + React portfolio.

Quick start

npm run start
# build
npm run build
# preview built site
npm run preview
```

Deploying to GitHub Pages

- Push this repo to GitHub (create a repo named e.g. `elbagoury-portfolio`).
- The included GitHub Actions workflow builds and deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages on `main`.

If you want me to archive duplicates (root `src/`, root `index.html`, `dist/`, `assets` build files, `server/`, `script/`), reply and I'll move them into `important_files/archive/` (non-destructive).
